# CMPSC 201: Representing Code

Given the following hypothetical omnibus production rule, how many different
derivations does it describe?
```
expr â†’ expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
     | IDENTIFIER
     | NUMBER
```

Copy enough of the numbered entry blocks below to describe the derivations.

1. `TODO: Replace this with the rule derivation` 
```
TODO: Copy and paste code blocks and populate with
      examples of the production rule in Lox.
```
