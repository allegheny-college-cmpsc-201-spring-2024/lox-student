# CMPSC 201: Parsing Statements

Consider the following `Lox` program:
```
var a = 1;
{
  var a = a + 2;
  print a;
}
print a;
```

1. What do you think the code does?

`TODO: Respond to the question above.`

2. Is that in line with what you think it _should_ do? Why or why not?

`TOOD: Respond to the question above.`

3. Code the same situation in Python. How does that one differ in form and function?
```python
TODO: Provide example from another language
```
`TODO: Explain how it does or doesn't differ from the Lox code`

4. What does the code at the top _actually_ do? How did it compare with your `Python` version?

`TODO: Respond to the question above.

5. What kind of behavior _should_ the code have?

As the book's author comments, this should probably be an error.
